# shortenurl
A web application for shortning long url to smaller urls
Url shortner Most of us are familiar with seeing URLs like bit.ly or t.co on our Twitter or Facebook feeds. These are examples of shortened URLs, which are a short alias or pointer to a longer page link. For example, I can send you the shortened URL http://bit.ly/SaaYw5 that will forward you to a very long Google URL with search results on how to iron a shirt. It would be much easier to text the 20-character bit.ly URL to your son who is in college and preparing for his first big job interview
